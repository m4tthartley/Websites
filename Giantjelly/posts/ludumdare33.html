    <p>Hi there!</p>

    <p>I recently participated in LudumDare 33 and I made a little game called
    Lumberjack Monster</p>

    <img src="/assets/posts/ludumdare33.png">

    <p>In the game you are a Lumberjack and your job is to cut down trees,
    but the trees won't go without a fight!</p>

    <p>I made it for Windows originally then ported it to Mac after the competition.
    But since porting it to Mac was such a fustrating experience I don't really want
    to try and port it to Linix. Next time I will make sure my base code is setup to do all
    platforms more easily.</p>

    <p>If you want to check out the game the
    <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=15450">competition page is here</a>.
    And if you're interested in game development I would definatley give LudumDare and go,
    it's a lot of fun!</p>

    <p>Another update on our space game should be soon!</p>
