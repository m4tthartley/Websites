<h1>Progress update #2</h1>
<div class="body">
	<p>Hello!</p>
	<p>Apparently when I said "more regular updates", I meant 3 months apart.
	We've been working on some cool things that we would like to show to you.</p>
	<p>These cool things include but are not limited to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Spaceship engine trails</li>
		<li>Basic lighting for the spaceships</li>
		<li>Save files</li>
		<li>Lots of under the hood engine updates</li>
	</ul>

	</div>

	<p>Some cool stuff but I'm going to try and work on lots of gameplay stuff now.
	I want to flesh out the gameplay and get it really fun to play before I continue
	doing fancy rendering and things like that.</p>
	<p>Nathan also showed me some awesome stuff to do with planets so hopefully
	we can show off some of that next time.</p>
	
	<p>Take care!</p>
