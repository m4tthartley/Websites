    <p>Good day!</p>

    <p>Sorry we haven't said anything in a looong time. I didn't want to write a post until we had gotten a reasonable amount of progress. We've been quite busy with work so we haven't done as much as I would have liked but here's what we've got so far:</p>

    <div class="video">

    <ul>
        <li>Added ships for the second faction "The Confederacy"</li>
        <li>Ship weapons can be changed at space stations</li>
        <li>Added weapon types, rockets and homing missiles</li>
        <li>Particle effects</li>
        <li>Explosion animations</li>
        <li>Health and shield level bars</li>
        <li>Collecting dropped cargo</li>
        <li>Enemy AI now follow a route and stop to fight when enemies are nearby</li>
        <li>Ship energy shield damage effect</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Nathan has been working on some nice sound effects and music so we should have some of that soon. I also re-wrote all the code in C/C++ at Christmas which is another reason it's taken a while to get to this point. But I'm very happy with the architecture now so progress should be a bit more consistent and I'll try to give you more regular updates.</p>

    <p>Thanks!</p>
