      <p>Hi, I'm Matt, a Gamer and Game developer living in rainy England.</p>
      <h2>Games</h2>
      <p>My favourite game is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, but I enjoy A wide range of games.</p>
      <h2>Game development</h2>
      <p>
        I have used many different technologies in the past, including Java, Lua and Unity3D.
        I could never quite find my home but about a year ago I discovered that I really like
        programming in C/C++. And then Handmade Hero came along and I switched to C-style C++
        for good.<br>Thank you Casey Muratori for teaching me to program again.
      </p>
      <P>
        At the moment I am working on a game in C/C++ using OpenGL for GPU rendering
        and absolutly no libraries.
      </P>
