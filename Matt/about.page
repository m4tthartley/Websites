[Programming and Game dev]

There have been many games that I have loved over the years but the ones that stand out are (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion), probably my favorite game and (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us The Last of Us).

I have used many different programming and game dev tools in the past, including Java, (http://www.lua.org/ Lua) and (https://unity3d.com/ Unity3D).

Ever since I started watching Handmade Hero I have programmed the handmade way.
