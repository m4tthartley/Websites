Hi, I'm Matt, a Gamer and Game developer living in rainy England.

[Games]

My favourite game is (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion), but I enjoy A wide range of games.

[Game development]

I have used many different technologies in the past, including Java, (http://www.lua.org/ Lua) and (https://unity3d.com/ Unity3D). I could never quite find my home but about a year ago I discovered that I really like programming in C/C++. And then (https://handmadehero.org/ Handmade Hero) came along and I switched to C-style C++ for good.

Thank you (https://twitter.com/cmuratori Casey Muratori) for teaching me to program again.

At the moment I am working on a game in C/C++ using OpenGL for GPU rendering and no libraries except the (https://github.com/nothings/stb STB libraries) cause they're pretty awesome.
