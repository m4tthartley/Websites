        I recently bought a PlayStation 3 to play all the games I missed out on because I never had one.
        One of the games I was most excited to play was The Last of Us having heard lots of good things about.
        So I got it with the PlayStation and I’m lost for words.
        I didn’t think it was possible for a game to be that immersive and emotional.
        I can’t find the words to describe how this game made me feel.
        It was worth buying the PlayStation just for this game, if you haven’t played it you need to.
        The Last of Us is most definitely the best game I have ever played.
