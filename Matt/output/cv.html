		<h3>Personal Details</h3>
		<p>Address: 39 Lightwood, Crown Wood, Bracknell, Berkshire, UK, RG12 0TR<br>

		<h3>Personal Statement</h3>
		<p>I love games and programming and I work on my own games and software as often as I can in my spare time.
		   I enjoy all aspects of game development and I like the process of designing my own games through programming, 
		   but I most enjoy low level engine programming from scratch using little to no libraries.
		   I also work on tools for my own use, such as asset processing tools for games and website generator tools.
		   Since I started programming I've used many different languages but currently I program almost exclusively in C/C++
		   as this gives me the most control and enjoyment. Although I feel that I'm good at programming I know there's
		   always more to learn and I'd love to work with some talented people and learn more.</p>

But to be honest I still spend most of my spare time programming.<br>
		I've learned to drive a car and have a clean driving licence.<br>
		I sometimes enter the Ludum Dare competition, a 48 hour game jam in which you have to make a game based on the set theme.
