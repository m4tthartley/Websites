<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Matt, a Gamer and Game developer living in rainy England.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p>My favourite game is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, but I enjoy A wide range of games.</p>
<h2>Game development</h2>
<p>
  I have used many different technologies in the past, including Java, <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> and <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>.
  I could never quite find my home but about a year ago I discovered that I really like
  programming in C/C++. And then <a href="https://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a> came along and I switched to C-style C++
  for good.<br>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/cmuratori">Casey Muratori</a> for teaching me to program again.
</p>
<P>
  At the moment I am working on a game in C/C++ using OpenGL for GPU rendering
  and no libraries except the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">STB libraries</a> cause they're pretty awesome.
